3,"Subject: Improving Your Loan Eligibility – Key Recommendations

Dear [Applicant's Name],

Thank you for considering Krungsri, Bank of Ayudhya for your financial needs. After reviewing your application, we’ve identified a few factors that may impact your eligibility. Below are tailored recommendations to help strengthen your creditworthiness and increase your chances of approval:

1. Low Credit Score (CIC Score < 600)
Your credit history shows past late payments, which can affect your score. To improve it:

Reduce credit card balances to lower your credit utilization ratio (aim for <30% of your limit).

Avoid new credit applications for 3–6 months before reapplying, as multiple inquiries can further lower your score.

2. Unstable Income (Freelancers/Gig Workers)
As a self-employed/independent worker, we understand income variability. To better demonstrate stability:

Submit 12 months of bank statements (instead of the standard 3–6 months) to show consistent cash flow.

Consider adding a creditworthy co-signer (e.g., a spouse or family member with stable income) to strengthen your application.

3. High Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI > 40%)
Your current debt obligations are high relative to your income. To lower your DTI:

Pay off small debts first (e.g., credit cards or personal loans) to reduce monthly payments.

Opt for a longer loan tenor (if applicable) to lower monthly payments—though this may increase total interest paid over time.

Next Steps
If you’d like to discuss these strategies in detail, we’d be happy to schedule a consultation.

Once adjustments are made, you may reapply with updated documentation for reconsideration.

We’re committed to helping you achieve your financial goals and are here to support you through this process. Feel free to reply to this email or call us at [phone number] for further guidance.

4,"Subject: Resolution of Collateral Valuation for Your Business Loan Application

Dear [Client's Name],

Thank you for your business loan application with Krungsri, Bank of Ayudhya. We appreciate the opportunity to support your restaurant’s expansion plans.

During our standard collateral review process, we identified a discrepancy in the valuation of your commercial property. While you estimated its value at THB 5 million, our internal appraisal currently places it at THB 4.2 million, resulting in a lower-than-expected Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio.

Our Review & Findings
We thoroughly examined the valuation report to ensure fairness, including:

Assessing whether recent renovations or location advantages (e.g., proximity to BTS) were fully accounted for.

Comparing the appraisal with recent market transactions of similar properties in your area.

While we stand by our initial valuation, we want to work with you to find a viable solution.

Available Options
To proceed with your loan request, we can explore the following alternatives:

Adjust the Loan Amount

Approve a reduced amount based on the current LTV (e.g., THB 2.94 million at 70% LTV of THB 4.2 million).

Supplement with Additional Collateral

Pledge additional assets, such as equipment, another property, or a personal guarantee, to cover the shortfall.

Request a Re-Evaluation

If you believe our valuation does not reflect the property’s true worth, we can facilitate a third-party appraisal (at your cost) for reconsideration.

Alternative Loan Structure

If collateral remains insufficient, we could structure a blended loan (partially secured/unsecured) with adjusted terms.

Strengthening Your Application
To improve approval chances, you may also:

Provide updated financial statements (e.g., demonstrating revenue growth, which you’ve already shown at 20% YOY).

Submit a revised business plan highlighting future cash flow stability.

Next Steps
Based on our discussion, you’ve kindly agreed to supplement with a personal guarantee and have provided updated financials. This allows us to approve your loan at a revised LTV. The final terms will be shared in a separate offer letter.

We’re committed to supporting your business growth and are happy to clarify any details. Please reply to this email or call me directly at [phone number] to discuss further.
