        "### Problem statement\n",
        "  In the dashboard, it can be confusing to distinguish applicants from each other, given that there are only a details present. Thai names are a unique problem since they are typically rather long, and make identifying documents error prone. This is especially useful for instances where the loans are specifically about business loans, and a large volume of documents including a business proposal or an earnings report is involved.\n",

        "### Proposed solution and workflow\n",
        "\n",
        "We propose to attach 3 tags to each loan application based on a pre-selected pool of tags. This is a Guided Topic modelling and tagging task, and we will thus be using BerTopic for this.\n",

        "----\n",
        "### Impact and risks\n",
        "\n",
        "Doing so will enable the officer to work more efficiently, as they will be able to recall applicants by the semantic information that they dealt with prior, or just have a preview to what to expect from the documentation.\n",

        "----\n",
        "\n",
        "### Possible areas for future improvements to be made:\n",
        "\n",
        "We can fine-tune the BerTOPIC pre-trained model for our task using PEFT (Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning) techniques like [RoSA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04679) and [GaLore](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03507) To obtain better responses. Alternatively, we can also fine-tune other aspects of BERTOPIC like its representation models, given that Bertopic is a very versatile and modular framework."
