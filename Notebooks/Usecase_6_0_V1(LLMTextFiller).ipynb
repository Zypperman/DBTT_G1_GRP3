        "### Proposed solution and workflow\n",
        "\n",
        "We can take automate these tasks with the use of LLMs via the following workflow:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. An officer summarises a few points that they want to convey to the user\n",
        "2. The officer then optionally selects a text snippet they'd like to use to respond to the user and \"control\" generation\n",
        "3. A preprocessing module takes this information and parses it into a prompt to be fed into an LLM. If a text snippet has already been selected, then the LLM will make use it as reference, otherwise we can use RAG to select the most appropriate text snippet for us.\n",
        "4. The LLM then generates a polite response from the prompt and presents it to the officer, to which the officer can then vet before sending to the applicant.\n",
        "\n",
        "----\n",
        "### Impact and risks\n",
        "\n",
        "Doing so will enable the officer to work more efficiently, as the content will be automatically generated and their task now shifts to assessing whether the generated content is viable for communicating with applicants, and editing accordingly, thus alleviating their workload for such menial tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "Furthermore, there are known studies where [humans perform better when editing work rather than through their own writing due to cognitive bias and familiarity](https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/633063/reason-its-so-hard-spot-your-own-typos), thus this would aid with mitigating human error when communicating with applicants.\n",
        "  \n",
        "However, we are aware that this may unwittingly result in officers haphazardly sending responses without properly reviewing them beforehand, thus it is important that they are aware of the ethical considerations with AI use and act accordingly.\n",
        "\n",
        "----\n",
        "\n",
        "### Possible areas for future improvements to be made:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Automated prompt engineering can be done to optimize the format of the prompt that is being used by the pre-processing module. We can adapt a workflow from [this article](https://medium.com/mantisnlp/automatic-prompt-engineering-part-ii-building-an-ape-workflow-88f2b2d68fc5) where:\n",
        "  1. Variations of prompt formats are entered and their associated LLM-parsed responses are collected from the LLM\n",
        "  2. Another LLM judges the responses and evaluates them based on selected metrics (which will be decided by MLOPs Engineers) or simply evaluated by ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) score, since we are effectively performing a summarisation task\n",
        "  3. picking the top responses and performing Automatic Prompt Optimization ([proposed in this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.03495.pdf)) on our best prompts so far until we reach a satisfactory metric score.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. We can fine-tune an LLM for our task using PEFT (Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning) techniques like [RoSA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04679) and [GaLore](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03507) To obtain better responses.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. This process can be further automated by inferring what changes need to be made using the information provided by usecases 3.0 and 3.1, where we can introduce reasoning modules and AI agents to be trained to assess how best to address the top-k risk factors, while also accounting for the document summary and tailoring a strategy for improving loan viability."

While you estimated its value at THB 5 million, our internal appraisal currently places it at THB 4.2 million, resulting in a lower-than-expected Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio.\\n\\nOur Review & Findings\\nWe thoroughly examined the valuation report to ensure fairness, including:\\n\\nAssessing whether recent renovations or location advantages (e.g., proximity to BTS) were fully accounted for.\\n\\nComparing the appraisal with recent market transactions of similar properties in your area.\\n\\nWhile we stand by our initial valuation, we want to work with you to find a viable solution.\\n\\nAvailable Options\\nTo proceed with your loan request, we can explore the following alternatives:\\n\\nAdjust the Loan Amount\\n\\nApprove a reduced amount based on the current LTV (e.g., THB 2.94 million at 70% LTV of THB 4.2 million).\\n\\nSupplement with Additional Collateral\\n\\nPledge additional assets, such as equipment, another property, or a personal guarantee, to cover the shortfall.\\n\\nRequest a Re-Evaluation\\n\\nIf you believe our valuation does not reflect the property\\u2019s true worth, we can facilitate a third-party appraisal (at your cost) for reconsideration.\\n\\nAlternative Loan Structure\\n\\nIf collateral remains insufficient, we could structure a blended loan (partially secured/unsecured) with adjusted terms.\\n\\nStrengthening Your Application\\nTo improve approval chances, you may also:\\n\\nProvide updated financial statements (e.g., demonstrating revenue growth, which you\\u2019ve already shown at 20% YOY).\\n\\nSubmit a revised business plan highlighting future cash flow stability.\\n\\nNext Steps\\nBased on our discussion, you\\u2019ve kindly agreed to supplement with a personal guarantee and have provided updated financials.

We appreciate the opportunity to support your restaurant\\u2019s expansion plans.\\n\\nDuring our standard collateral review process, we identified a discrepancy in the valuation of your commercial property. While you estimated its value at THB 5 million, our internal appraisal currently places it at THB 4.2 million, resulting in a lower-than-expected Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio.\\n\\nOur Review & Findings\\nWe thoroughly examined the valuation report to ensure fairness, including:\\n\\nAssessing whether recent renovations or location advantages (e.g., proximity to BTS) were fully accounted for.\\n\\nComparing the appraisal with recent market transactions of similar properties in your area.\\n\\nWhile we stand by our initial valuation, we want to work with you to find a viable solution.\\n\\nAvailable Options\\nTo proceed with your loan request, we can explore the following alternatives:\\n\\nAdjust the Loan Amount\\n\\nApprove a reduced amount based on the current LTV (e.g., THB 2.94 million at 70% LTV of THB 4.2 million).\\n\\nSupplement with Additional Collateral\\n\\nPledge additional assets, such as equipment, another property, or a personal guarantee, to cover the shortfall.\\n\\nRequest a Re-Evaluation\\n\\nIf you believe our valuation does not reflect the property\\u2019s true worth, we can facilitate a third-party appraisal (at your cost) for reconsideration.\\n\\nAlternative Loan Structure\\n\\nIf collateral remains insufficient, we could structure a blended loan (partially secured/unsecured) with adjusted terms.\\n\\nStrengthening Your Application\\nTo improve approval chances, you may also:\\n\\nProvide updated financial statements (e.g., demonstrating revenue growth, which you\\u2019ve already shown at 20% YOY).\\n\\nSubmit a revised business plan highlighting future cash flow stability.\\n\\nNext Steps\\nBased on our discussion, you\\u2019ve kindly agreed to supplement with a personal guarantee and have provided updated financials. This allows us to approve your loan at a revised LTV. The final terms will be shared in a separate offer letter.\\n\\nWe\\u2019re committed to supporting your business growth and are happy to clarify any details.
